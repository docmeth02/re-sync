re:sync - rsync clone for zanka wired
    usage:
        re-sync [options] srcpath destpath

    options:
        -v      verbose mode
        -q      quiet mode

    path:
        you have to use both a remote and a local path

        local: /my/local/path
        wired: wired://username:password@my.wiredserv.er/remote/path

        Without adding user, password or port to the remote path, config file
        defaults will be used. If a section named after the hostname is found
        in the config file default settings will get overridden.
